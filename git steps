step-by-step guide to clone a Git repository using your URL: https://github.com/mandirigma009/web.git. 

Step 1: 
Install Git (if you haven’t already)
Go to Git official website
Download the installer for your OS (Windows, Mac, Linux).
Run the installer with default options (it will install Git Bash and Git command line).
After installation, open Command Prompt or Git Bash.

Step 2: 
Navigate to the folder where you want the project
Open Command Prompt or Git Bash.
Use the cd command to go to your desired folder. 
For example: cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents

This will be the folder where your project will be cloned.

Step 3: 
Clone the repository
Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL:
git clone https://github.com/mandirigma009/web.git
Git will create a folder called web in your current directory.
It will download all the code and Git history from the remote repository.

Step 4: 
Enter the cloned folder
After cloning, move into the project folder:
cd web
Now you are inside the project folder and can start working with it.

Step 5: 
Verify the repository
To check that the repository is properly cloned, you can run:
git status


It should show something like:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean


This confirms your clone was successful.
